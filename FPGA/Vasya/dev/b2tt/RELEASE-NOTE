  Auto delay scan to decide the idelay value
  b2link down to stop the trigger
  hold most of the errors until cleared

  SVN release, to be used with belle2link 0.08

* version 0.28 - 2014.07.29 Mikihiko Nakao
  b2tt_symbol definition is revised in a non-backward compatible way
  to work with ft2u059 and later versions
  
* version 0.29 - 2014.08.08 Mikihiko Nakao
  b2tt_payload is in a separate file to make it usuable for other part
  of the cascaded FTSW chain

* version 0.30 - 2014.08.27 Mikihiko Nakao
  runreset fix: now runreset is a 1 revolution cycle long signal
  busyup handling at runreset is fixed

* version 0.31 - 2014.09.17 Mikihiko Nakao
  sim_speedup option to bypass most of the iscan initialization code
  clock may be provided from an external source instead of clk_p/clk_n
  from RJ45 poart.

* version 0.34 - 2015.01.14 Mikihiko Nakao
  - gtpreset is generated when clk is lost and recovered
  - no more raw ddr signal out, rawclk now goes through bufg
  - jtag handling code added
  - trigger mask control from ftsw
  - cleanup unused signals

* version 0.36 - 2015.02.27 Mikihiko Nakao
  - several serious bug fix, to fix tagerr and timerr
  - to be compatible with latest ftsw firmware
  - this version is not fully compatible with ft2u065 and earlier

* version 0.37 - 2015.03.10 Mikihiko Nakao
  - stareset signal was not properly implemented -> fixed
  - clraddr feature to fix incorrectly assigned address

* version 0.38 - 2015.04.28 Mikihiko Nakao
  - b2tt encode fix (mostly affecting ft[23]x firmware)
  - clraddr from b2tt_decode (not used by b2tt.vhd)

* version 0.39 - 2015.05.26 Mikihiko Nakao
  - b2tt decode fix to avoid tagerr when mask is cleared

* version 0.40 - 2015.05.28 Mikihiko Nakao
  - b2tt divclk1 / divclk2 fix: clkdiv1=2 didn't work before

* version 0.45 - 2016.03.31 Mikihiko Nakao
  - 254MHz clock input option for DHH with recovered clock
  - b2tt decode fix mix up is fixed
  - changes: spartan-6 invclock, cnt_trig for timing constraint
  - b2tt_decode trgmask
  - SEU mitigation bits rearranged

* version 0.46 - 2016.04.07 Mikihiko Nakao
  - trgtag + 1 before filling fifo
  - trgmask fix

* (version 0.47 was an incorrect fix, should not be used)

* version 0.48 - 2016.06.29 Mikihiko Nakao
  - fix in 0.46 was not correct, trgtag has to be latched one clock earlier,
    now fixed
  - fifordy signal was still asserted at the next clock after ttnext
    is received, now it is deasserted at the next clock of ttnext

* still version 0.48 - 2017.02.06 Mikihiko Nakao
  - 7-series FPGA support is included
  - idelay bug fix for 7-series: b2tt_ddr_x7.vhd

* version 0.52 2017.08.02 Mikihiko Nakao
  - Major update of the protocol, especially on the return path from
    FEE to FTSW.
  - Reorganized format to be able to collect all needed info from FEE
  - To make it possible, more commands to FEE are added
  - Revolution signal, injection veto related signals are added
  - new files: b2tt_injv.vhd b2tt_revo.vhd
  - changed files: b2tt_decode.vhd b2tt_encode.vhd b2tt_payload.vhd
    b2tt_fifo.vhd b2tt_symbols.vhd
