WARNING:ConstraintSystem:137 - Constraint <NET "Qclock" TNM_NET = "Qclock";>
   [Pre.ucf(2)]: No appropriate instances for the TNM constraint are driven by
   "Qclock".

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:56 - Constraint <TIMESPEC TS_Qclock = PERIOD "Qclock"
   25 ns HIGH 50 % INPUT_JITTER 375 ps;> [Pre.ucf(3)]: Unable to find an active
   'TNM' or 'TimeGrp' constraint named 'Qclock'.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:137 - Constraint <NET "MuxClock_in" TNM_NET =
   "MuxClock_in";> [Pre.ucf(9)]: No appropriate instances for the TNM constraint
   are driven by "MuxClock_in".

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:56 - Constraint <TIMESPEC TS_MuxClock_in = PERIOD
   "MuxClock_in" 25 ns HIGH 50 % INPUT_JITTER 375 ps;> [Pre.ucf(10)]: Unable to
   find an active 'TNM' or 'TimeGrp' constraint named 'MuxClock_in'.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:137 - Constraint <NET "ADC_DCO_LVDS[1]" TNM_NET =
   "ADC_DCO_LVDS1";> [Pre.ucf(31)]: No appropriate instances for the TNM
   constraint are driven by "ADC_DCO_LVDS<1>".

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:119 - Constraint <NET "ADC_DCO_LVDS<1>"
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE;> [Pre.ucf(32)]: This constraint cannot be
   distributed from the design objects matching 'NET "ADC_DCO_LVDS<1>"' because
   those design objects do not contain or drive any instances of the correct
   type.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:56 - Constraint <TIMESPEC TS_DCO1 = PERIOD
   "ADC_DCO_LVDS1" 3125 ps HIGH 50 %;> [Pre.ucf(33)]: Unable to find an active
   'TNM' or 'TimeGrp' constraint named 'ADC_DCO_LVDS1'.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:191 - The TNM 'Qclock', does not directly or indirectly
   drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMS and cannot be actively used by the
   referencing Period constraint 'TS_Qclock'. If clock manager blocks are
   directly or indirectly driven, a new TNM constraint will not be derived even
   though the referencing constraint is a PERIOD constraint unless an output of
   the clock manager drives flip-flops, latches or RAMs. This TNM is used in the
   following user PERIOD specification:
   <TIMESPEC TS_Qclock = PERIOD "Qclock" 25 ns HIGH 50 % INPUT_JITTER 375 ps;>
   [Pre.ucf(3)]

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:197 - The following specification is invalid because
   the referenced TNM constraint was removed:
   <TIMESPEC TS_Qclock = PERIOD "Qclock" 25 ns HIGH 50 % INPUT_JITTER 375 ps;>
   [Pre.ucf(3)]

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'FCT_40', used in period specification

   output(s):

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:191 - The TNM 'MuxClock_in', does not directly or

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:191 - The TNM 'ADC_DCO_LVDS1', does not directly or
   indirectly drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMS and cannot be actively
   used by the referencing Period constraint 'TS_DCO1'. If clock manager blocks
   are directly or indirectly driven, a new TNM constraint will not be derived
   even though the referencing constraint is a PERIOD constraint unless an
   output of the clock manager drives flip-flops, latches or RAMs. This TNM is
   used in the following user PERIOD specification:
