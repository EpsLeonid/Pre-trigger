WARNING:ConstraintSystem:137 - Constraint <NET "FCT_40" TNM_NET = "FCT_40";>
   [Pre.ucf(5)]: No appropriate instances for the TNM constraint are driven by
   "FCT_40".

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:56 - Constraint <TIMESPEC TS_FCT_40 = PERIOD "FCT_40"
   25 ns HIGH 50 % INPUT_JITTER 375 ps;> [Pre.ucf(6)]: Unable to find an active
   'TNM' or 'TimeGrp' constraint named 'FCT_40'.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:137 - Constraint <NET "ADC_DCO_LVDS[1]" TNM_NET =
   "ADC_DCO_LVDS1";> [Pre.ucf(30)]: No appropriate instances for the TNM
   constraint are driven by "ADC_DCO_LVDS<1>".

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:119 - Constraint <NET "ADC_DCO_LVDS<1>"
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE;> [Pre.ucf(31)]: This constraint cannot be
   distributed from the design objects matching 'NET "ADC_DCO_LVDS<1>"' because
   those design objects do not contain or drive any instances of the correct
   type.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:56 - Constraint <TIMESPEC TS_DCO1 = PERIOD
   "ADC_DCO_LVDS1" 3125 ps HIGH 50 %;> [Pre.ucf(32)]: Unable to find an active
   'TNM' or 'TimeGrp' constraint named 'ADC_DCO_LVDS1'.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:191 - The TNM 'FCT_40', does not directly or indirectly
   drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMS and cannot be actively used by the
   referencing Period constraint 'TS_FCT_40'. If clock manager blocks are
   directly or indirectly driven, a new TNM constraint will not be derived even
   though the referencing constraint is a PERIOD constraint unless an output of
   the clock manager drives flip-flops, latches or RAMs. This TNM is used in the
   following user PERIOD specification:
   <TIMESPEC TS_FCT_40 = PERIOD "FCT_40" 25 ns HIGH 50 % INPUT_JITTER 375 ps;>
   [Pre.ucf(6)]

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:197 - The following specification is invalid because
   the referenced TNM constraint was removed:
   <TIMESPEC TS_FCT_40 = PERIOD "FCT_40" 25 ns HIGH 50 % INPUT_JITTER 375 ps;>
   [Pre.ucf(6)]

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'MuxClock_in', used in period specification
   'TS_MuxClock_in', was traced into DCM_ADV instance DLL/DCM_ADV_INST. The
   following new TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the
   DCM_ADV output(s): 
   CLK0: <TIMESPEC TS_DLL_CLK0_BUF = PERIOD "DLL_CLK0_BUF" TS_MuxClock_in HIGH
   50% INPUT_JITTER 375 ps>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'MuxClock_in', used in period specification
   'TS_MuxClock_in', was traced into DCM_ADV instance DLL/DCM_ADV_INST. The
   following new TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the
   DCM_ADV output(s): 
   CLK2X: <TIMESPEC TS_DLL_CLK2X_BUF = PERIOD "DLL_CLK2X_BUF" TS_MuxClock_in / 2
   HIGH 50% INPUT_JITTER 375 ps>

INFO:ConstraintSystem:178 - TNM 'MuxClock_in', used in period specification
   'TS_MuxClock_in', was traced into DCM_ADV instance DLL/DCM_ADV_INST. The
   following new TNM groups and period specifications were generated at the
   DCM_ADV output(s): 
   CLKDV: <TIMESPEC TS_DLL_CLKDV_BUF = PERIOD "DLL_CLKDV_BUF" TS_MuxClock_in * 2
   HIGH 50% INPUT_JITTER 375 ps>

WARNING:ConstraintSystem:191 - The TNM 'ADC_DCO_LVDS1', does not directly or
   indirectly drive any flip-flops, latches and/or RAMS and cannot be actively
   used by the referencing Period constraint 'TS_DCO1'. If clock manager blocks
   are directly or indirectly driven, a new TNM constraint will not be derived
   even though the referencing constraint is a PERIOD constraint unless an
   output of the clock manager drives flip-flops, latches or RAMs. This TNM is
   used in the following user PERIOD specification:
   <TIMESPEC TS_DCO1 = PERIOD "ADC_DCO_LVDS1" 3125 ps HIGH 50 %;> [Pre.ucf(32)]
